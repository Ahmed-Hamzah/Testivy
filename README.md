# Testivy.

Create your own tests, and record your progress with Testivy.
After logging in, you'll be taken to the 'Your Tests' page, which will be empty at first. Go to 'Your Chapters', and create a chapter, and proceed to add questions in the chapter. You can now create a test of that chapter by navigating to the tests page. Once you submit the test, you can view your score in it, and the test will now be moved to the 'Your Records' section, where you can view all your previous tests.

The tests and chapters are all stored in an SQL database using Django models.
